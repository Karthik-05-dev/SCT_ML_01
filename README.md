🏠 Task 01 - House Price Prediction
This project is part of the Machine Learning Internship by SkillCraft Technologies (SCT). The objective is to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various input features.

🚀 Problem Statement
Predict the selling price of houses based on different features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc., using supervised machine learning (regression) techniques.

📌 Dataset
The dataset contains various features of residential houses.
It includes numerical and categorical variables.
Data was cleaned and preprocessed before modeling.
🛠 Technologies Used
